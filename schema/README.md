The schemas in this directory describe the details object in a request or response. The schema used is specified in the request objects pattern property, which contains a URL linking to a schema publicly-available on the web.

The process for developing or changing a request/response schema currently involves submitting a PR to the contents of this directory. JSON schema is an IETF draft standard. For more information on JSON schema, see https://json-schema.org/specification.html.

Note: schemas for container objects that send requests, responses and commmands are provided in /ext/schema.
